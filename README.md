# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis using Apache Spark

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Apache Spark's DataFrame API. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is `walmart_stock.csv`. The contents and structure of this dataset are not immediately clear from the initial markdown cells of the notebook. For more information, refer to the original notebook.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to perform EDA on the given dataset using Apache Spark. The steps in the notebook include:

1. Creating an Apache Spark Session.
2. Loading the `walmart_stock.csv` file into a DataFrame and inferring the data schema.
3. Displaying the column names and printing the DataFrame schema.

## Results

The detailed results and insights from the EDA are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Please refer to the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the project outcomes.
